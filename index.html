    <p>
        - Who am I? I honestly can't answer that (countless people have written about this problem).
        - A few facts (resume conversation): Ecuadorian, Princeton Computer Science undergrad, I've built two software businesses — currently building customer service AI at <a href="https://recado.co">recado.co</a> (second business).
        - I didn't use AI to write this page
        - I've lately been exploring reading, journaling, philosophy, calligraphy.
        - I've been exploring minimalism and burnout recovery.
