        <strong>Who am I?</strong>
        I'll try to answer
    </p>

    Who am I? I honestly can't answer that (countless people have written about this problem).
    - A few facts (resume conversation): Ecuadorian, Princeton Computer Science undergrad. Right after Princeton, I built vivid.lol with two of my best friends. I left Vivid right before it got acqui-hired by Vercel AI.
    I'm working on my second company, building customer service AI at <a href="https://recado.co">recado.co</a>.
        - I didn't use AI to write this page
        - I've lately been exploring reading, journaling, philosophy, calligraphy.
        - I've been exploring minimalism and burnout recovery.
